# Meta Mask Assesment

Given the context of smart contracts and their features, this completes module 2 of the ETH + AVAX Assessment.

# Description
Giving ETH and depositing it completes the Metamask Assessment. I created and controlled how I could obtain ETHs, run them using VS Code Chrome over Gitpod, and keep them running into a browser by using Localhost and VS Code. We can learn how to effectively limit within Metamask and via the front-end and back-end thanks to functions like npm and npx.

## Getting Started
If possible, download VSCode and Node.js; if not, use Chrome. After that, access GitHub using the Metacrafters beginning template and modify the terminal there!


# Starter Next/Hardhat Project

After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/
