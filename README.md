# SMART-CONTRACT-MANAGEMENT
A smart contract management platform is a system that aids in the creation, deployment, and management of smart contracts. 
## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has two functions that returns the uint and add the input. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future

## Getting Started

We have two functions which is the VIEW AND PURE.

## View Function
We defined an unsigned uint ehich is public. We call it X = 5
We also implement two function which we call ADDTO X which takes as input and uint y.
Y has the public attribute means it can be called anywhere but it cannot modify the blockchain.

## Pure Function
Pure function means it neither reads nor writes from the blockchain.
It returns uint and add I and J,

## Executing Program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "HelloWorld" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the sayHello function. Click on the "HelloWorld" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the "sayHello" function. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and retrieve the "Hello World!" message.
