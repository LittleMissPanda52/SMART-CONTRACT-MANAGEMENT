# Meta Mask Assesment

Given the context of smart contracts and their features, this completes module 2 of the ETH + AVAX Assessment.

# Description
Giving ETH and depositing it completes the Metamask Assessment. I created and controlled how I could obtain ETHs, run them using VS Code Chrome over Gitpod, and keep them running into a browser by using Localhost and VS Code. We can learn how to effectively limit within Metamask and via the front-end and back-end thanks to functions like npm and npx.

## Getting Started
If possible, download VSCode and Node.js; if not, use Chrome. After that, access GitHub using the Metacrafters beginning template and modify the terminal there!


# Starter Next/Hardhat Project

After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal execute npm i.
2. In your second terminal, input npx hardhat node.
3.  and another terminal for npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js to give the host 1 eth
4. Return to the first terminal and execute npm run dev to launch the front-end.

Following this, the project will run on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/.
